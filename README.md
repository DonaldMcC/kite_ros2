# kite_ros2

This will be a port of kite_ros to work with ros2 and hopefully combined with a cleanup of the main code and an improved user interface.  Advantages should be that it will run on both windows and pi relatively happily.  There is no advanced ros stuff invovled just basic messaging so not anticipating too many challenges with the main package.  However I do intend to keep using both a wii controller and arduino for the main hardware - potentially a few more issues in getting these up and running.
